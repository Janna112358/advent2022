# advent2022

My solutions for [advent of code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/). I'm not trying to score points (i.e. get up early and try to solve the problems as fast as possible). I'm just having fun writing some F# code ([why?](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/why-use-fsharp/)).

## Input files

Father Christmas has requested the input files are not publicised along with AoC code. If you want to run this code, you can download the data from the [AoC website](https://adventofcode.com).
